AkamaiTracker
=============

To audit changes in your model 


Setup
======

1)run
	./script/generate akamai_tracker add_trackers_table

This command will create a trackers table where all the changes will be audited


2)copy these lines in config/development or /production

		class Tracker < ActiveRecord::Base                                           
		end                                                                           
		Tracker.logger = nil    

The idea is to turn off the sql logging of trackers table. This significantly imporves the 
performance over 5sec

3)Include this module in appcliacteion_controller.rb under controllers
	
	include Akamai::Track::Setup

Example
=======

Example goes here.

consider a model Mobile with attributes "details" and "mtype"

Ex:1 =>
class Mobile
	track_this_model :only => [:details, :mtype], :on => [:update,:destroy]
end

Now any time if a record is updated or destroyed and there is a change in value of either attributes or both, corresponding new record will be inserted in trackers table
with old and previous value along with the user info who did the changes.


Ex:2 =>
class Mobile
	track_this_model :except => [:details], :on => [:create]
end

self explanatory


Generic info
=============
1)plugin offers three callbacks  = :update, :destroy and :update if mothing is specified auditing will happen on all these callbacks

2)if no specific columns are mentioned then auditing will happen for all the attributes
